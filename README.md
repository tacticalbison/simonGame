## Things I learned in this section

**<u>jQuery:</u>** This was a very interesting subject and allowed me to experiment with using a library to control DOM elements.

---

**<u>Personal notes</u>**: I got a job about partway through this project and took a break between some of the steps and a few things I learned include: when learning a new job and getting comfortable, it is easy to ignore outside learning and it took a little time to get comfortable at work and get to a point where I felt like I could take time from outside work hours to devote to this learning experience. It also was quite interesting to see how much I had to rely on the documentation to remind myself of the syntax of jQuery as I hadn't used it in some time. This just goes to show, that if I know the basics of what I'm trying to do and understand the approach to the problem to solve, I can use outside documentation to remind myself of things and get it done. I don't need to remember every single thing about the libraries I work with.
